# THIS REPO IS NOW MOVED TO [MOSIP Infra Repo](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-infra).  There is no further development on this repo.


# MOSIP Developer Installer

The scripts here enable a developer to run MOSIP modules on a single machine with very low memory configuration.  The module Jars are run directly without any containerization.  

## Running the Installer

- This Installer runs on CenOS 7. Create a new VM with CentOS 7. The installer was tested with CentOS-7-x86_64-DVD-1810.iso with 8GB RAM, 2 CPU configuration.
- Make sure network is enabled on the VM.
- Create a new user, login as this user.
- Add current user to `/etc/sudoers` file.     
- Install git:  
`$ sudo yum install git`
- Create `mosip` directory in home directory.
- `$ cd $HOME/mosip`
- Clone this repo:    
`$ git clone https://github.com/pjoshi751/mosip-dev-installer.git`
- Install Python3.6 and other tools:  
`$ cd mosip-dev-installer`  
`$ sh prerequisites.sh`
- Modify `config_server/mosip_configs/kernel.properties` to add your Gmail account SMTP credentials in the following fields:    
`spring.mail.username=<user email id>`   
 `spring.mail.password=<password>`
- `$ cd $HOME/mosip` 
- Clone `mosip-platform` repo:  
`$ git clone https://github.com/mosip/mosip-platform.git`    
`$ cd mosip-platform`  
`$ git checkout 0.9.0_phil`  
- Run installer as below (do **not** run with `sudo`):  
`$ cd $HOME/mosip/mosip-dev-installer/launcher`  
`$ ./launcher --help`  
`$ ./launcher --install-environ` (one time)  
`$ ./launcher --build-code`  
`$ ./launcher --start-services`  
- Monitor the logs under `launcher/logs` dir for any errors.  
`$ grep ERROR *`
- Once all services are up, run a test api under `launcher/test/api_test.py`. For the OTP email test, you will have to allow Google to receive emails from apps (lesser security setting).  
`$ cd launcher/test/`  
`$ python3.6 api_test.py`  

## LDAP UI tool
- For inspecting contents of LDAP, download and install Apache Studio DS
http://directory.apache.org/studio/download/download-linux.html
- Create a new connection with following params: host = localhost, port = 10389, Simple Authentication, Bind DN = "uid=admin,ou=system", Bind password = "secret"

## Notes
- config server runs on port 8888 by default.  It may conflict with some services. TODO: Change the port.
